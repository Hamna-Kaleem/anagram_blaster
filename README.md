# Anagram Blaster 2.0

Anagram Blaster 2.0 is a fun and engaging word scramble game built with Python Flask and JavaScript. This version is an enhanced update of my original Anagram game, featuring difficulty levels, validation against a dictionary API, and dynamic difficulty adjustment based on player performance.

## Why I Built This

As part of my journey with the NLP community and inspired by my previous Anagram game on GitHub, I wanted to create a more robust and interactive version — Anagram Blaster 2.0. Leveraging AI-assisted development, I was able to write cleaner code faster, although there were some repetitive patterns in styling and scripting.
Overall, the project took me about half the time I’d normally expect, thanks to AI help. I’m excited to share this version with the retro gaming and developer communities!
I did some initial mind mapping and wrote basic game logic myself. The clean and efficient code was significantly aided by Amazon Q's AI development CLI. While the AI did great at code structure and logic, some repetitive styling and JavaScript patterns emerged which I left as-is for simplicity.
This project is a great example of how AI can accelerate game development, cutting down build time significantly.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
